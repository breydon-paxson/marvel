  		WELCOME!

	<p>Welcome to the Marvel Movies Explained Website&excl; This website serves strictly as a base source of information for the Marvel Movies. Here we have a quick background of what the Marvel Movies are, as well as a more in depth look at four of our favorite Marvel movies&excl; Trust me, choosing these four were extremely hard as all Marvel movies are amazing. This is a great place for someone new to Marvel, to start their Marvel journey. However, beware, you may develop a severe addiction to the Marvel Universe. Once your addiction begins there are thousands of comics series and various in depth analysis all over the web for you to get your hands on. One of the best things about Marvel is that it is extremely hard to run out of content to consume. It would take you roughly 917 days straight without breaks to read all of the comics&excl;</p>
	<p>If reading is not your think it takes approximately 50 hours to watch the whole entire Marvel universe! So grab your bucket of popcorn and take the next couple of days off so you can watch them all!</p>
